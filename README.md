# dt-grpc-ts
A simple gRPC client for Draw Things written in TypeScript for Node.js

(just a demo for now - I'll release an NPM package at some point)

To use, clone the repo, `yarn install`, `yarn build`, then run the examples in the example folder. For example, `yarn exec tsx src/examples/img2img.ts`
